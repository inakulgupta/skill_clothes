# Week 5 and 6
TODO:
 1) Identify the workings of BERT- pretrained model on hugging-face data.

 2) Integrate model with dialogue flow agent

 3) code and test the bot flows with BERT in the dialogue flow agent


Done:
1)Trained the pretrained BERT model with our skill- intents for multi-intent classification.

3s/step - loss: 0.5718 - balanced_accuracy: 0.7918 - val_loss: 0.1653 - val_balanced_accuracy: 0.81

2)Updated the training dataset with more utterances to get better responses for customer queries.
